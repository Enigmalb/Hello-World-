# Hello-World-
First Repository 
I’ve started with Career Karma.  I’m Really excited, I’ve done fast track and applied to Lambda and Kenzie Bootcamps. My application has been approved for the next step for both. Lambda has a pre course I must do and the Start date is Sept 3rd.  And I have an appointment with Kenzie next Thursday for an interview.

My problem is that I've chosen iOS, and they're pre-course requires a app download  called Xcode. Which only runs on a Mac os 10.  All I have is an iOS tablet.  I really need a Mac laptop.  I have HUD for housing, Oregon Health Plan for medical, and food stamps.  I'm 57, I babysit my granddaughter for about 200.00 a month.  It's time for this change in my life...but I need a little help to get there...
